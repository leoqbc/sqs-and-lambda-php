## Notes
### Ephemeral storage

> By default, Lambda allocates 512 MB for a function’s /tmp directory. You can increase or decrease this amount using the Ephemeral storage (MB)
> setting. To configure the size of a function’s /tmp directory, set a value between 512 MB and 10,240 MB in 1-MB increments.
